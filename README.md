# digital-sound
A repo of data and scripts used for my article "A Twitter Case Study for Assessing Digital Sound"

Data includes only the Twitter id_str values. One can "hydrate" these ids (retrieve the corresponding JSON data) using Ed Summers's excellent [twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc) Python library. Upon request, I will also supply the complete dataset.
